# OldCalculator

## About project

This project is a old style calculator which we used at the school. There is no special. When I've created this app, I wanted that this calculator have looks like an old style. 
Main thing which I like in this App is a memory buttons, which is not available on all calculator app which I found.

So, you can try to use this app, I will glad :)
